<h1>This is an h1</h1>
<p>That h1 is the heading for the body (a sectioning root).</p>
<div>
<h1>This is another h1</h1>
<p>That h1 is inside a div so it is no different than the first h1.</p>
</div>
<section>
<h1>This is also an h1</h1>
<p>That h1 is the heading for a section (sectioning content). It acts like an h2 in the context of the whole document.</p>
</section>
